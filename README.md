# Controls

## Food Shortcuts
There are 3 new slots for your food bound to **Number Pad** 1, 2 and 3. They can be repurposed to arrows etc.

There are also slots specifically for equipped gear. When you return to your tombstone after death it will attempt to put everything back in it's slot, but I haven't died yet so behaviour is unknown.

## Build Camera

Try pressing **B** while the hammer is equipped! This unlocks the camera from your character so you can get a better angle. The controls are typical WASD plus spacebar for UP. It can be a bit disorienting at first because it often starts you off facing the floor.

Press **B** again or switch tools to exit. You are still restricted to building in reach of your character.

## Quick Stack Sort Restock Trash

**Quick Stack** - Default Keybind: P
Non-favourited items will be placed in storage **within 8m** which already contain that item. 

**Sort** - Default Keybind: O
Items in your inventory or the selected container will be sorted. 

**Restock** - Default Keybind: L
Favourited items will be restocked from nearby chests.
*Caution* - it will take as many as are available to fill any partial stacks you have. You may find yourself weighed down by 60 meals.

**Trash**
Click and drag items to the trash icon on the right side of your inventory menu.

**Favourite and Quick Trash Items**
Ctrl-Click on an item to mark it as a favourite, so that it doesn't quick stack away. It will get a thin border to indicate.

## QOL Plugins
**Slope Combat Assistance**
Your attacks will be higher or lower if you look up or down while attacking.

**Fast Portals**
There's no longer a built-in minimum delay on portal travel.

**Compass**
There's a compass at the top of your screen now.

## Plant Easily
I'm probably the only one actually using this but let me know if you want to know more.

## Configuration Manager
All the above mods can be reconfigured using the **Configuration Manager**, but it's not pretty. Press the * key on your numpad to open and close it.
